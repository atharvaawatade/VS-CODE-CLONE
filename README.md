## üí° Development Notes

### Monaco Editor Integration
The Monaco Editor is integrated via the `@monaco-editor/react` package, which provides a React wrapper around the editor used in VS Code. Our implementation includes:

- Custom theme matching VS Code's dark theme
- Language auto-detection based on file extensions
- Editor state preservation across tab switches
- Scroll synchronization and minimap

### Terminal Implementation
Our terminal is built using xterm.js with custom animations:

- ANSI escape sequences for colors and cursor positioning
- Custom Matrix-style animation using calculated character streams
- Command history implementation with state management
- Simulated file system interactions

### Gemini API Integration
The AI features leverage Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model:

- Context-aware prompting by including the current file's content
- Consistent response formatting with proper markdown
- Code block extraction and syntax highlighting
- Direct application of suggested code to the editor

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Extensions Support**: Create a marketplace for simple extensions
- **Git Integration**: Add basic git operations
- **Multiple Themes**: Support for light mode and custom themes
- **Split View Editing**: Edit multiple files side by side
- **Debugger Integration**: Basic debugging capabilities for JavaScript
- **Settings Customization**: User preferences with persistent storage
